# unfollowly

Get notified when someone unfollows you on social media.

This is something that I wish social media had. It would stimulate so much more usage of the platform (anxious usage, if any). This application will only notify you for any future unfollows from the time you activated our server to the time you turned it off.

## Installation

To download:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VladUsatii/unfollowly.git
cd unfollowly
chmod +x main.py
./main.py
```

## Supported Apps

* Instagram
